# ipradiotelevisaum
Just a simple IPTV/Radio list for my streaming needs, based on the mighty [M3UPT](https://github.com/LITUATUI/M3UPT).

Radio stations are my thing. I'll be updating the list to use it on my work setup. Also, I've been kindly accepted to update as well [M3UPT](https://github.com/LITUATUI/M3UPT) as it goes. This will be updated first and will be a test bed of sorts.
